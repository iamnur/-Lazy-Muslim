            Islam teaches that God has sent prophets to humanity, in different
            times and places, to communicate His message. Since the beginning of
            time, God has sent His guidance through these chosen people. They
            were human beings who taught the people around them about faith in
            One Almighty God, and how to walk on the path of righteousness.

        <h2>The Prophet's Message</h2>
        <p>
          In Islam we believe that all prophets gave guidance and instruction to
          their people about how to properly worship ALLAH (SWT) and live their
          lives. Since God is One, His message has been one and the same
          throughout time. In essence, all prophets taught the message of Islam
          - to find peace in your life through submission to the One Almighty
          Creator; to believe in God and to follow His guidance.

      <h2>The Quran on the Prophets</h2>
      <p>
        "The Messenger(Muhammad Sallahu Alaihi Wa'sallam) believes in what has
        been sent down to him from his Lord, and (so do) the believers. Each one
        believes in Allah, His Angels, His Books, and His Messengers. (They say)
        'We make no distinction between one and another of His Messengers.' -And
        they say, 'We hear, and we obey. (We seek) Your Forgiveness, Our Lord,
        and to you is the return (of all) ." (2:285)
      </p>
     <a href="/prophets.html"> <h2>The Prophets' Names</h2></a>
      <p>
        There are 25 prophets mentioned by name in the Quran, although Muslims
        believe that there were much more in different times and places. Among
        the prophets are:
        <br />
        <li>Prophet Muhammad Sallahu Alaihi Wasallam</li> <br>
        <a href="/prophets.html">Full List</a>
        <h2>Honoring the prophets</h2>
        <p>Muslims read about, learn from, and respect all of the prophets. Many Muslims name their children after them. In addition, when mentioning the name of any of God's prophets, a Muslim adds these words of blessing and respect: "upon him be peace" (alayhi salaam in Arabic).
